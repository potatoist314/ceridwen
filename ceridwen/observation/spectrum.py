class Spectrum(Observation):
    """
    Spectroscopic observation.

    Stores a densely-sampled spectrum together with optional resolution and
    multiplicative flux-calibration arrays.  Provides helpers for masking
    spectral regions, computing chi-squared residuals, and projecting the
    spectrum onto broadband filters.

    Parameters
    ----------
    wavelength : array-like, shape (n_pix,)
        Wavelength grid [Å], vacuum, **observed frame** (as delivered by the
        instrument).  ``setup_for_model(wave_model, zred=...)`` redshifts the
        rest-frame *model* grid by (1 + zred) and interpolates onto these
        pixels; at ``zred = 0`` observed and rest frame coincide.
    flux : array-like, shape (n_pix,)
        Observed flux.  Units must be consistent with ``uncertainty`` and
        any model spectra passed to ``chi_sq`` / ``residuals``.
        Ceridwen model spectra are in L_sun Hz^{-1} M_sun^{-1}.
    uncertainty : array-like, shape (n_pix,)
        1-sigma uncertainty, same units as ``flux``.
    mask : array-like of bool or slice, shape (n_pix,)
        True for pixels that are *used* (not masked).
    resolution : float or array-like, optional
        Instrumental smoothing width.  Interpretation depends on
        ``smoothtype``:

        * ``smoothtype=None`` — stored but never applied.
        * ``"vel"`` — scalar σ_v [km/s].
        * ``"R"``   — scalar resolving power R = λ/σ_λ.
        * ``"lambda"`` — scalar σ_λ [Å].
        * ``"lsf"`` — 1-D array of σ(λ) [Å] at each observed pixel.
    smoothtype : {"vel", "R", "lambda", "lsf"} or None
        Type of instrumental broadening to apply in ``predict``.  See the
        ``__init__`` docstring and ``setup_for_model`` for full details.
        Default ``None`` (no smoothing, backward-compatible).
    inres : "auto" or float, optional
        Intrinsic resolution of the model (SSP library), subtracted in
        quadrature before applying the target smoothing.  Default
        ``"auto"``: the wavelength-dependent library curve stored in the
        SSP grid (``SSPData.ssp_resolution``) is used, threaded in by
        ``SedModel`` via ``setup_for_model(..., lib_resolution=...)``;
        when smoothing is enabled and no curve is available this is a
        hard error.  An explicit float is an expert override (a constant
        width in the units of ``smoothtype``: km/s for vel/R, Å for
        lambda/lsf; ``0.0`` disables the subtraction entirely).
    calibration : array-like, shape (n_pix,), optional
        Multiplicative flux-calibration vector (model × calibration ≈ data).
        When set, it is applied as a per-pixel multiplicative correction to
        the model inside ``chi_sq``, ``residuals``, and ``log_likelihood``
        (and inside the noise-floor inflation in ``_effective_sigma``).
        For the alternative analytic-marginalisation path, see
        ``fit_polynomial_calibration``.
    logify_spectrum : bool
        If True, ``chi_sq`` and ``residuals`` operate in log-flux space
        (residuals are Δln f / σ_ln f).
    sky : array-like, shape (n_pix,), optional
        Observed sky background spectrum, same units and pixel grid as
        ``flux``.  When provided, the sky is subtracted from the data
        before computing chi-squared residuals:
        ``residual = (flux - sky - model) / sigma``.
        The sky vector is *not* propagated through ``predict``; it enters
        only in ``chi_sq``, ``residuals``, and ``log_likelihood``.
    noise_floor : float, optional
        Fractional uncertainty floor applied to the model flux.  The
        effective per-pixel sigma used in chi-squared becomes:

        .. math::

            \\sigma_{\\rm eff}^2 = \\sigma^2 + (f_{\\rm floor}\\,|m|)^2

        where :math:`f_{\\rm floor}` is ``noise_floor`` and :math:`m` is
        the model flux.  Prevents chi-squared from being dominated by
        pixels where the photon-noise uncertainty is smaller than
        calibration systematics.  Default 0.0 (disabled).
    sigma_losvd : float or None, optional
        Galaxy line-of-sight velocity dispersion [km/s].  When set, an
        additional velocity-broadening step is applied to the model
        spectrum *before* any instrumental smoothing specified by
        ``smoothtype``.  Useful when sigma_losvd is a free parameter of
        the SED fit.  Requires a call to ``setup_for_model`` whenever
        this value changes.  Default None (disabled).
    noise : GaussianProcess or None, optional
        If a ``GaussianProcess`` instance is provided, its log-likelihood
        contribution is added to the standard Gaussian log-likelihood in
        ``log_likelihood()``, accounting for correlated residual
        structure.  ``chi_sq`` is not affected by this attribute (it
        remains a simple diagonal chi-squared).

        Parameters
        ----------
        smoothtype : {"vel", "R", "lambda", "lsf"} or None
            Which instrumental smoothing kernel to apply in ``predict``:

            ``"vel"``
                Constant velocity dispersion.  ``resolution`` is a velocity
                width [km/s].  Uses a log-λ FFT so the kernel is
                shift-invariant in velocity.
            ``"R"``
                Constant spectral resolving power.  ``resolution`` is the
                scalar R value.  Because "R" is quoted in BOTH conventions
                in the literature (R = λ/FWHM on instrument datasheets,
                e.g. NIRSpec "R = 1000"; R = λ/σ_λ in the sedpy/Prospector
                tradition), ``res_convention`` is REQUIRED for this
                smoothtype — there is no safe default.
            ``"lambda"``
                Constant wavelength width.  ``resolution`` is in Å.
                Uses a linear-λ FFT.
            ``"lsf"``
                Wavelength-dependent line-spread function.  ``resolution``
                must be a 1-D array of the wavelength width [Å] evaluated
                at the *observed* pixel wavelengths (``self.wavelength``).
                The kernel is interpolated to the model wavelength grid
                inside ``setup_for_model``.
            ``None`` (default)
                No smoothing applied; ``predict`` performs pure linear
                interpolation (``_H @ spectrum``).  ``resolution`` is stored
                but unused in this mode.

        res_convention : {"sigma", "fwhm"} or None
            Whether ``resolution`` quotes a Gaussian dispersion σ or a
            FWHM (FWHM = 2.3548 σ).  Applies to every smoothtype:

            * ``"sigma"`` — ``resolution`` is σ_v ("vel"), R = λ/σ_λ
              ("R"), or σ_λ ("lambda"/"lsf").
            * ``"fwhm"``  — ``resolution`` is FWHM_v ("vel"),
              R = λ/FWHM_λ ("R", the usual instrument-datasheet number),
              or FWHM_λ ("lambda"/"lsf").

            Default: ``"sigma"`` for "vel"/"lambda"/"lsf" (the standard
            convention for those quantities).  For ``smoothtype="R"`` it
            MUST be given explicitly — passing a datasheet R = λ/FWHM
            where λ/σ is expected silently over-broadens the model by
            2.3548×, so the constructor raises rather than guess.

        inres : "auto" or float, optional
            Intrinsic (library) resolution of the input model spectrum,
            subtracted in quadrature before applying the target smoothing.
            ``"auto"`` (default) uses the wavelength-dependent curve stored
            in the schema-2.x SSP grid (see the class docstring) — leave it
            alone unless you know better.  An explicit float is a constant
            expert override, ALWAYS a Gaussian σ (never FWHM), in km/s for
            "vel"/"R" and Å for "lambda"/"lsf"; 0.0 disables the
            subtraction entirely.

        ``_predict_fn`` — the single callable used by ``predict``.

        Must be called once (Python-level, outside JIT) after the model
        wavelength grid is known.  ``SedModel.__init__`` calls this
        automatically.

        Two behaviours depending on ``self.smoothtype``:

        **No smoothing** (``smoothtype=None``)
            Builds the dense (n_pix, n_wave) linear-interpolation matrix
            ``_H`` and sets ``_predict_fn(spec) = _H @ spec``.

        **With instrumental smoothing** (``smoothtype`` in
        ``{"vel", "R", "lambda", "lsf"}``)
            Uses a factory function from ``sedpy_jax.smoothing`` to
            precompute all FFT grid transforms.  The returned closure is
            fully JAX-JIT-compilable with respect to the spectrum.
            ``_predict_fn(spec)`` applies smoothing *and* interpolation to
            the observed pixel grid in one call.  ``_H`` is also built (used
            only by the no-smoothing fast path).

        Parameters
        ----------
        wave_model : array-like, shape (n_wave,)
            Rest-frame model wavelength grid [Å], strictly increasing.
        zred : float, optional
            Fixed redshift at which to precompute the spectral projection.
            Default 0 (rest-frame).  For ``zred > 0`` the interpolation
            maps from the observed-frame grid
            ``(1 + zred) * wave_model`` onto ``self.wavelength`` (which is
            interpreted as observed-frame pixel wavelengths), preserving
            the predict-time GEMV fast path.
        lib_resolution : (wave_rest, sigma_v_kms) tuple, optional
            The SSP library resolution curve: rest-frame wavelengths [Å]
            and per-pixel Gaussian dispersion sigma_v [km/s] (NaN where
            unknown), as stored in ``SSPData.ssp_resolution``.
            ``SedModel`` threads this in automatically.  Consumed only
            when ``self.inres == "auto"`` and instrumental smoothing is
            enabled; sigma_v is frame-invariant, so the curve applies at
            observed pixel ``(1+z)·λ_rest`` unchanged.  Required in that
            case — a smoothing-enabled Spectrum with ``inres="auto"`` and
            no curve raises (pass an explicit ``inres`` float to opt out).
