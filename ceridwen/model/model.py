=======================
Parameter manager and model-prediction layer for Ceridwen SED fitting.

Design
------
``SedModel`` is the central object connecting the forward model (CSPBasis) to
a set of observations and a prior specification.  It satisfies two interfaces
simultaneously:

1. **Model interface** (consumed by ``MultiObservationLikelihood``):
   ``model.predict(theta)`` must return a ``dict[str, Array]`` keyed by
   observation name, where each value is the model prediction for that
   datum type.

2. **Prior interface** (consumed by ``MultiObservationLikelihood.make_lnprobfn``
   as the ``prior`` argument):
   ``prior.log_prob(theta)`` must return a scalar log-prior.

Both are implemented on this single class; there is no separate "prior manager"
object.  This mirrors Prospector's ``SpecModel`` pattern while keeping the
code as lean as possible.

Architecture::

    SedModel
    ├── csp             : CSPBasis instance (forward model)
    ├── observations    : list[Observation]
    ├── priors          : dict[str, Prior]
    ├── transforms      : dict[derived_name → callable(free_theta)]
    ├── predict(theta)       → dict[obs.name → Array]  (calls csp.predict)
    ├── apply_transforms(θ)  → dict  (free_theta → model_theta)
    ├── ln_prior(theta)      → scalar  (sum of log-priors on free params)
    ├── log_prob(theta)      → scalar  (alias for ln_prior)
    ├── theta_init           → dict[str → Array]  (free parameters only)
    ├── param_names          → list[str]  (free parameters only)
    └── obs_dict             → dict[str → Observation]

Compatibility with ``likelihood.py``
-------------------------------------
``MultiObservationLikelihood.make_lnprobfn(observations, model, prior)``
expects::

    observations : dict[str, Observation]   # keyed by obs.name
    model.predict(theta) → dict[str, Array] # same keys
    prior.log_prob(theta) → Array           # scalar

Usage::

    model = SedModel(csp, observations=[phot, spec], priors={
        "sfh":  Uniform(low=0.0, high=1.0),
        "Z":    Normal(mean=-1.5, sigma=0.5),
    })

    # Forward prediction
    preds = model.predict(theta)   # {"my_phot": Array(n_filters,), ...}

    # Prior
    lnp = model.ln_prior(theta)

    # Build JIT-compiled posterior for blackjax

    Parameter manager + prediction layer for Ceridwen SED fitting.

    Parameters
    ----------
    csp : CSPBasis
        Initialised composite stellar population model.  Must expose
        ``csp.wave``, ``csp.theta_init``, and
        ``csp.predict(theta, observations)``.
    observations : list of Observation
        Data containers (Photometry, Spectrum, Lines, StellarIndices). Each must have a
        unique ``.name`` attribute.
    priors : dict[str, Prior], optional
        Mapping from *free*-parameter name to a prior object implementing
        ``logpdf(x) -> Array``.  Parameters absent from this dict receive
        no prior contribution (flat improper prior).
    transforms : dict[str, callable], optional
        Mapping from *derived* (CSP) parameter name to a callable that
        computes its value from the free-parameter dict::

            model_theta[derived] = fn(free_theta)

        Derived parameters listed here are removed from the free-parameter
        list and replaced by the new free parameters supplied via
        ``free_param_init``.  This mirrors Prospector's ``depends_on``
        mechanism.

        Example — fitting log-ratios of SFR bins instead of raw SFH::

            from ceridwen.model.transforms import logsfr_ratios_to_sfh

            transforms = {
                "sfh": lambda t: logsfr_ratios_to_sfh(
                    t["logsfr_ratios"],
                    sfh_times_yr=csp.sfh_times,
                )
            }

    free_param_init : dict[str, Array], optional
        Initial values for free parameters that *replace* derived ones.
        Keys in this dict are added to ``param_names`` and ``theta_init``;
        the corresponding derived params (``transforms`` keys) are removed.
        Required when ``transforms`` is not empty.

    Attributes
    ----------
    theta_init : dict[str, Array]
        Initial values for the **free** parameters only (derived params
        are absent; their replacements from ``free_param_init`` are present).
    param_names : list[str]
        Ordered list of free-parameter names.
    transforms : dict[str, callable]
        Registered transforms (empty dict if none).
    obs_dict : dict[str, Observation]
        Observations keyed by ``obs.name``.
    wave : Array, shape (n_wave,)
        Model wavelength grid [Å].

        Draw a publication-quality probabilistic graphical model (PGM) diagram.

        The diagram follows standard PGM conventions:

        - Open circles       — stochastic latent variables (free parameters θᵢ)
        - Stacked circles    — vector-valued parameters (e.g. SFH weight vector)
        - Double-bordered rectangle — deterministic SED computation f_ν(λ)
        - Coloured rectangles — observation projection operators
        - Filled circles     — observed data (shaded = conditioned upon)
        - Dashed arrows      — prior ↦ parameter dependency (ε ≡ stochastic edge)
        - Solid arrows       — deterministic dependency (θ → f_SED → ŷ → y)

        The figure adapts dynamically to however many parameters and
        observations are registered, making it immediately suitable for
        inclusion in a paper.

        Parameters
        ----------
        ax : matplotlib.axes.Axes, optional
            Axes to draw into.  If *None* a new figure is created.
        figsize : (float, float), optional
            Figure size in inches ``(width, height)``.  Defaults scale
            automatically with the number of free parameters.
        return_fig : bool, optional
